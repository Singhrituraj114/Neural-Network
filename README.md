Neural Network Projects
This repository is composed by different projects that use neural networks to solve a problem or perform some task. The problems tackled are simple enough to be solved with really simple models. The objective is trying to explain each step of the process for each of them in Jupyter Notebooks as well as well as providing python scripts to perform the job. Model will be built using different libraries (Tensorflow, Keras, etc).
